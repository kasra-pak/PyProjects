# Topic
The dice rolling simulator will imitate the experience of rolling a dice.
It will generate a random number and the user can play again and again to get a number from the dice until the user decides to quit the program.

# Issues
in dice_with_gui.py couldn't place the two RadioButtons at the center (mean while keeping the colors and themes)
