# Topic
Build a graphical user interface calculator using a library like Tkinter in which we build buttons
to perform different operations and display results on the screen.
You can further add functionalities for scientific calculations.

# explanation
Most of the calculator implementations (using tkinter) available online are following a
simple approach to get the job done (i.e. getting a string of expressions, evaluate them and printing the result). But as you know none of the classic and standard calculators work that way.
So, in this project i tried to simulate my adorable "CASIO HL-812L" calculator.
This means all the functionalities are much as same as the real calculator (CASIO).
Fortunately or not this made the coding a little bit harder, sepcially the parts handling the operations and floating points.

# Issues

# TODOs
* Upload a picture of the casio calculator
* Add functionality for "MR", "M-", "M+" buttons
* Add functionality for "%" button
